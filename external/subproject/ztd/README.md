# `ztd.text`

> Because if text works well in two of the most popular systems programming languages, the entire world over can start to benefit properly.

This repository is an implementation of an up and coming proposal percolating through SG16, [P1629 - Standard Text Encoding](https://thephd.github.io/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/d1629.html). It will also include implementations of some downstream ideas covered in Previous Work in this area, including Zach Laine's [Boost.Text (proposed)](https://github.com/tzlaine/text), rmf's [libogonek](https://github.com/libogonek/ogonek), and Tom Honermann's [text_view](https://github.com/tahonermann/text_view).



# Current Plans

The current roadmap is to obtain funding to make text encoding viable in time for standardization for C++23. See the [roadmap](https://ThePhD.github.io/portfolio/text) for details.
