Known Unicode Encodings
=======================

Out of all the encodings listed on the :doc:`encodings page </encodings>`, only a handful are known to be Unicode Encodings. These are as follows:

- UTF-7
- UTF-7-IMAP
- UTF-8
- UTF-16 (All Endiannesses)
- UTF-32 (All Endiannesses)
- GB18030
- CESU-8
- MUTF-8
- WTF-8
- UTF-1
- UTF-EBCDIC

When the encoding is known at compile time (e.g., it is just a plain object), it contains a ``is_unicode_encoding`` type member that is set to ``std::true_type``. Otherwise, it is left off. This is detected by :doc:`ztd::text::contains_unicode_encoding </api/contains_unicode_encoding>` and :doc:`ztd::text::is_unicode_encoding </api/is_unicode_encoding>`.

If you know of any others, please let us know!
