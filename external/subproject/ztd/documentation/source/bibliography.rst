	iconv
		Bruno Haible and Daiki Ueno. libiconv. August 2020. URL: `https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=libiconv <https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=libiconv>`_. `A software library <https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>`_ for working with and converting text. Typically ships on most, if not all, POSIX and Linux systems.

	ICU
		Unicode Consortium. "International Components for Unicode". April 17th, 2019. URL: `https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs <https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs>`_ The premiere library for not only performing encoding conversions, but performing other Unicode-related algorithms on sequences of text.

	libogonek
		R. Martinho Fernandes. "libogonek: A C++11 Library for Unicode". September 29th, 2019. URL: `http://site.icu-project.org/ <http://site.icu-project.org/>`_ One of the first influential C++11 libraries to bring the concept of iterators and ranges to not only encoding, but normalization and others. It's great design was only limited by how incapable C++11 as a language was for what its author was trying to do.

	encoding_rs
		Henri Sivonen. "encoding_rs". February 2021. URL: `https://github.com/libogonek/ogonek <https://github.com/libogonek/ogonek>`_. A Rust library for performing encoding and decoding tasks. Takes a byte-based approach to handling encodings and decodings. The developer of this library worked on text for a very long time on Mozilla Firefox, and has great insight into the field of text `on their blog, https://hsivonen.fi <https://hsivonen.fi>`_.
	
	p0244
		Tom Honermann. "P0244 - Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library". URL: `https://wg21.link/p0244 <https://wg21.link/p0244>`_. A C++ proposal written by Tom Honermann, proposing some of the first ideas for an extensible text encoding interface and lightweight ranges built on top of that. Reference implementation: `https://github.com/tahonermann/text_view <https://github.com/tahonermann/text_view>`_.
	
	Non-Unicode in C++
		Henri Sivonen. "P0244 - Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library". URL: `https://hsivonen.fi/non-unicode-in-cpp/ <https://hsivonen.fi/non-unicode-in-cpp/>`_. A rebuttal to P0244's "strong code points" and "strong code units" opinion. This is talked about in depth in the design documentation for :doc:`strong vs. weak code point and code unit types </design/strong vs weak code points>`.

	p1041
		R. Martinho Fernandes. "P1041: Make char16_t/char32_t string literals be UTF-16/32". February 2019. URL: `https://wg21.link/p1041 <https://wg21.link/p1041>`_. This accepted paper enabled C++ to strongly associate all ``char16_t`` and ``char32_t`` string literals with UTF-16 and UTF-32. This is not the case for C.

	glibc-25744
		Tom Honermann and Carlos O’Donnell. ``mbrtowc`` with Big5-HKSCS returns 2 instead of 1 when consuming the second byte of certain double byte characters. `https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25744 <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25744>`_. This bug report details the problem with the C standard library's ability to handle multiwide characters. This problem is also present in the "1:N" and "N:1" rules in the C++ standard library.

	n2282
		Philip K. Krause. "N2282 - Additional multibyte/wide string conversion functions". June 2018. URL: `http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2282.htm <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2282.htm>`_. This paper attempted to add a few unicode functions to the list of things to do without changing anything.

	Fast UTF-8
		Bob Steagall. "Fast Conversion from UTF-8 with C++, DFAs, and SSE Intrinsics". September 26th, 2019. URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FQ87-Ecb-A <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FQ87-Ecb-A>`_. This presentation demonstrates one of the ways an underlying fast decoder for UTF-8 can be written, rather than just letting the default work. This work can be hooked into the :doc:`conversion function extension points </design/converting>` location.

	Fast UTF-8 Validation
		Daniel Lemire. "Ridiculously fast unicode (UTF-8) validation". October 20th, 2020. URL: `https://lemire.me/blog/2020/10/20/ridiculously-fast-unicode-utf-8-validation/ <https://lemire.me/blog/2020/10/20/ridiculously-fast-unicode-utf-8-validation/>`_. This blog post is one of many that presents a faster, more optimized way to validate that UTF-8 is in its correcty form.
