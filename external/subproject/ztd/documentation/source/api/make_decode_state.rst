make_decode_state
=================

This detects when the ``decode_state`` of a given ``encoding`` requires the ``encoding`` itself to make said state. If so, it will call the ``decode_state``\ 's constructor with the encoding passed in. Otherwise, it simply default-constructs a state. In either case, the constructed value is returned to the user.

The classification for this is done by :doc:`ztd::text::is_decode_state_independent </api/is_decode_state_independent>`.
