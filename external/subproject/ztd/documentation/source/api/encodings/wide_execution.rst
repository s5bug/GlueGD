Wide Execution
==============

This is the locale-based, wide runtime encoding. It uses a number of compile-time and runtime heuristics to eventually be resolved to an implementation-defined encoding. It is not required to work in constant expressions either: for this, use :doc:`ztd::text::wide_literal </api/encodings/wide_literal>`, which represents the compile-time wide string (e.g. ``L"my string"``) encoding.

Currently, the hierachy of behaviors is like so:

- If the platform is Windows, then it assumes this is :doc:`UTF-16 </api/encodings/utf16>`;
- Otherwise, if libiconv is available, then it attempts to use :doc:`iconv </api/encodings/basic_iconv>` configured to the ``"wchar_t"``-identified encoding;
- Otherwise, if the platform is MacOS and ``WCHAR_MAX`` is greater than the maximum of an unsigned 21-bit number, or ``__STDC_ISO_10646__`` is defined, then it attempts to use :doc:`UTF-32 </api/encodings/utf32>`;
- Otherwise, if the headers ``<cwchar>`` or ``<wchar.h>`` are available, then it attempts to use a gnarly, lossy, and dangerous encoding that potentially traffics through the C Standard Library and Locale APIs in conjunction with a roundtrip through the :doc:`ztd::text::execution </api/encodings/execution>` encoding;
- Otherwise, it produces a compile-time error.

.. warning::

	The C Standard Library has many design defects in its production of code points, which may make it unsuitable even if your C Standard Library recognizes certain locales (e.g., Big5-HKSCS). The runtime will always attempt to load ``iconv`` if the definition is turned on, since it may do a better job than the C Standard Library's interfaces until C23.

Even if, on a given platform, it can be assumed to be a static encoding (e.g., Apple/MacOS where it always returns the "C" Locale but processes text as UTF-32), ``ztd::text::wide_execution`` will always present itself as a runtime and unknowable encoding. This is to prevent portability issues from relying on, e.g., ``ztd::text::is_decode_injective_v<ztd::text::wide_execution>`` being true during development and working with that assumption, only to have it break when ported to a platform where that assumption no longer holds.
