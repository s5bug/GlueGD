Modified UTF-8
==============

Modified Unicode Transformation Format 8 (MUTF-8) is a UTF-8 format employed by some Android components and other ecosystems. It's special property is that it encodes the NULL character in C-style strings (``'\0'``) as an overlong sequence. This is normally illegal in UTF-8, but allowed here to allow easier interoperation with these systems.
