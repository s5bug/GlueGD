ðŸ”¨ cuneicode_encoding (In Progress)
===================================

.. warning::

	|unfinished_warning|

This encoding is only available if the :ref:`configuration macro for ZTD_TEXT_USE_CUNEICODE <config-ZTD_TEXT_USE_CUNEICODE>` is turned on.

This encoding is tied to the `cuneicode library <https://ztdcuneicode.rtfd.io>`_. The cuneicode library is a C library for validation, counting, and transcoding between a fixed set of encodings, with an additional plug for arbitrary encodings that can be added at run-time. This is in opposition to :doc:`iconv </api/encodings/basic_iconv>`, where additional encodings can only be added by-hand through recompiling the code or hooking specific system configuration points.

cuneicode has a variable number of encodings it can be compiled with to support. States are pre-constructed in the encoding itself and copied as necessary when ``encode_state`` or ``decode_state``\ s are being created to call the desired conversion functions. The user can inspect the output error parameter from the ``cuneicode_encoding`` constructor to know of failure, or not pass in the output error parameter and instead take one of a assert, thrown exception, or ``abort`` (preferred invocation in that order).
