is_(bitwise\ _)transcoding_compatible
=====================================

This classification checks if two encodings are compatible, or bitwise compatible. The heuristic for normal compatibility is simple:

- it checks if the two encodings are identical;
- it checks if the two encodings are near-identical derivations of one another (e.g., :doc:`UTF-8 </api/encodings/utf8>` being converted to :doc:`MUTF-8 </api/encodings/mutf8>` (but not in the other direction)); or,
- it checks if the code point types between the two encodings are the same, or if they are :doc:`both some form of unicode code point </api/is_unicode_code_point>`.

This type specifically uses the first type as the ``From`` encoding (e.g., the one to decode the input code unit sequence) and the second type as the ``To`` encoding (e.g., the one to encode the intermediate decoded code point sequence).

	⚠️ Specializing this type for types which are not either transcoding compatible or bitwise compatible can result in |ub| within the library.
