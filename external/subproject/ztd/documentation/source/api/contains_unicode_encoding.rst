contains_unicode_encoding
=========================

This function determines whether or not the type is or contains a unicode encoding. This means any encoding wherein the entirety of Unicode, all 21 bits, can be represented without loss of information. For a full list of encodings which are considered Unicode Encodings by this library, see :doc:`the Known Unicode Encodings list</known unicode encodings>`.

This function checks for 2 things.

- It checks to see if the call ``encoding.contains_unicode_encoding()`` is well-formed and returns a boolean value. If this is the case, it calls ``encoding.contains_unicode_encoding()`` and returns that value.
- It looks to see if the provided ``encoding`` has a member type called ``::is_unicode_encoding``. If this is the case, then it returns ``is_unicode_encoding_v<Type>``.

If none of these work, then it returns ``false``.
