default_handler
===============

The default handler for all operations. A class type that simply wraps :doc:`ztd::text::replacement_handler_t </api/error handlers/replacement_handler>` unless configured otherwise. You can change it to throw by default (NOT recommended) by using :ref:`ZTD_TEXT_DEFAULT_HANDLER_THROWS <config-ZTD_TEXT_DEFAULT_HANDLER_THROWS>`.

Using this type, implicitly or explicitly, signals to ztd.text that you would like it to gently admonish you if any part of a conversion could be potentially lossy (valid data is put in, but it cannot be handled by the desired encode/decode/transcode operation).
