throw_handler
=============

The ``throw_handler`` simply throws a :doc:`ztd::text::encoding_error </api/encoding_error>` as an exception. This should only EVER be used for pre-verified, trusted input sources, debugging purposes, or similar; malformed text is a common enough occurrence that throwing errors by default or using this handler by default is a **bad idea** in almost every way.

Throwing on encoding, decoding, and other errors can easily result in Denial of Service target points if this is used in conjunction with user or untrusted input sources.
