pass_handler
============

The ``pass_handler`` does exactly what its name implies: it passes the error as generated by the encoding object through without touching it. Unlike :doc:`ztd::text::assume_valid_handler </api/error handlers/assume_valid_handler>`, this one does not invoke undefined behavior because it does not meet the :doc:`ztd::text::is_ignorable_error_handler </api/is_ignorable_error_handler>` traits.
