is_decode_injective_v
=====================

Looks to see if the ``decode_one`` operation on a given encoding type is :term:`injective <injective>`.

This classification checks whether the given encoding type has a type definition called ``is_decode_injective`` on it, and if it does checks to see if its ``std::true_type``. If it's not present, or if it's ``std::false_type``, then the encoding is assumed to NOT be :term:`injective <injective>`.
