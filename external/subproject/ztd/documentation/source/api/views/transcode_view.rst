transcode_view
==============

The ``transcode_view`` class provides a one-by-one view of the stored range's code units as another encoding's code units. Dereferencing the iterators returns a single ``code_unit`` value corresponding to the desired encoding's type.

The range-based classes are excellent ways to walk over units of information in a low-memory environment, as they only store the minimum amount of data necessary to perform their operations on the fly. This reduces the speed but is fine for one-at-a-time encoding operations. To decode eagerly and in bulk, see :doc:`the transcode functions </api/conversions/transcode>`.
