propagate_error
===============

This helper function processes an error for a transcoding operation and shuffles a result through its decode step and encode step :doc:`error handlers</design/error handling>`. Nominally used after a solely decode portion of a transcode operation fails.

If the user is doing a direct conversion and can simply call the encode portion of the error handler directly, calling this function can be skipped entirely by the user.
