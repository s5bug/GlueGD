``ztd.text``
============

The premiere library for handling text in different encoding forms and reducing transcoding bugs in your C++ software.



Who Is This Library For?
------------------------

If:

- you want to convert from one Unicode encoding to another Unicode encoding;
- you want a no-overhead way to track and keep data in a specific encoding (Unicode-based or not);
- you want a no-memory-overhead way to archive;
- you want to prevent data in the wrong encoding from infiltrating your application and causing `Mojibake <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake>`_;
- you want to work with higher-level primitives (code points, graphames) when iterating text that do not break your text apart;
- you want safe defaults for working with text;

then ``ztd.text`` is for you!
