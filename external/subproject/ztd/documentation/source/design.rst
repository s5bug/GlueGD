Design Goals and Philosophy
===========================

The goal of this library are to

- enable people to write new code that can properly handle encoded information, specifically text;
- offer them effective means to convert that information in various ways;
- impose no run-time overhead compared to writing the code by hand; and
- statically track encodings, where possible, to make lossless or bad conversions a compile time error rather than a runtime problem;

These four goals inform the design of the library to its deepest levels and helps us go through the following important tenents:
