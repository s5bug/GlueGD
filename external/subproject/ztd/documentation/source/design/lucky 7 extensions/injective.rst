Injective: Promoting Safety in Encodings
========================================

As detailed in the :doc:`/design/error handling/lossy protection` section, ``is_encode_injective`` and ``is_decode_injective`` help the library understand when a conversion you are doing cannot be guaranteed at compile time to be lossless. :term:`Injectivity <injective>` is a high-brow mathematical term:

.. epigraph::

	In mathematics, an injective function (also known as injection, or one-to-one function) is a function that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain.

	-- `Wikipedia, February 2nd, 2021 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function>`_


This is very fancy speak for the fact that for every complete, well-formed input value, there is a well-formed, distinct output value. It does not have to cover all of the potential output values: so long as there is a one-to-one mapping that is unambigious for all the input values, it is injective. For practical purposes, it means that all of the code unit sequences that are valid can produce a unique code point sequence ("the decode operation is injective"). And, in the reverse case, it means that all the code point sequences that are valid can produce a unique code unit sequence ("the encode operation is injective").

These two properties appear on the type itself, and is a way to opt-in to saying that a conversion is not lossy (e.g., it preserves information perfectly if the input is well-formed). You can define them by placing them on your Encoding Object Type's definition:

.. code-block:: cpp
	:linenos:
	:emphasize-lines: 2-3

	struct any_unicode_byte_encoding {
		using is_decode_injective = std::true_type;
		using is_encode_injective = std::true_type;
		using code_unit = std::byte;
		using code_point = ztd::text::unicode_scalar_value;
		// …
	};

This signals that the ``encode_one`` and ``decode_one`` functions — if they are given well-formed input — will never be lossy between their ``code_point`` type and their ``code_unit`` types when performing the desired operation. If only one half of that equation is lossy, then you can mark only one, or the other. For example, :doc:`ztd::text::ascii </api/encodings/ascii>` is lossy only in for the ``encode_one`` operation, so it has ``is_decode_injective = std::true_type;`` for ``decode`` operations, but ``is_encode_injective = std::false_type;`` for ``encode`` operations:

.. literalinclude:: /../../include/ztd/text/ascii.hpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:dedent: 1
	:lines: 74-76,95-107,273
	:emphasize-lines: 4-16

If the type definition is not present and is not ``std::true_type``, then the implementation assumes that this is false for a given encoding. See :doc:`ztd::text::is_decode_injective </api/is_decode_injective>` and :doc:`ztd::text::is_encode_injective </api/is_encode_injective>` for more information.
