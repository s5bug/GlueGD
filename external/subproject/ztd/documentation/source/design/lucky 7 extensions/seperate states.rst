Separate Encode/Decode States
=============================

It is no secret that encoding and decoding may carrying with them separate states. While converting from a legacy encoding to Unicode may require maintenance of a shift state or code unit modifier, the opposite direction may not need any at all. Therefore, as an optimization, an encoding object can define both an ``encode_state`` and a ``decode_state``, seperate from each other. As an example, here is a (simplified) version of how :doc:`ztd::text::execution </api/encodings/execution>`, the encoding for the Locale-based Runtime Execution Encoding, has two seperate states that need to be initialized in different manners:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/snippets/source/runtime_locale_encoding.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:lines: 56-57,65-84,246

This is the proper way to initialize a ``std::mbstate_t`` from the C standard library. Then, you can use it! Here's a complete implementation using the new ``encode_state`` and ``decode_state`` types:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/snippets/source/runtime_locale_encoding.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:lines: 56,127-246

This allows you to maintain 2 different states, initialized in 2 different ways, one for each of the ``encode_one`` and ``decode_one`` paths.
