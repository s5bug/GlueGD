Validate Decodable
==================

Validation is the way to verify a given sequence of input can have a specific action performed on it. Particularly, we check here if the input of code units can be turned into code points of the given encoding. The way it does this, however, is two-fold:

- it first decodes the input code units, to see if it can do the transformation without loss of information; then,
- it encodes the output from the last step.

The algorithm for this is as follows:

* ‚è© Is the ``input`` value empty? Return the current results with the the empty ``input``, ``valid`` set to true, and ``state``\ s, everything is okay ‚úÖ! Otherwise,

   0. Set up an ``intermediate`` storage location of ``code_point``\ s, using the ``max_code_points`` of the input encoding, for the next operations.
   1. Set up an ``intermediate_checked_output`` storage location of ``code_unit``\ s, using the ``max_code_units`` of the output encoding, for the next operations.
   2. Do the ``decode_one`` step from ``input`` (using its ``begin()`` and ``end()``) into the ``intermediate`` ``code_point`` storage location.

      * üõë If it failed, return with the current ``input`` (unmodified from before this iteration, if possible), ``valid`` set to false, and ``state``\ s.

   3. Do the ``encode_one`` step from the ``intermediate`` into the ``intermediate_checked_output``.

      * üõë If it failed, return with the current ``input`` (unmodified from before this iteration, if possible), ``valid`` set to false, and ``state``\ s.

* ‚è© Update ``input``\ 's ``begin()`` value to point to after what was read by the ``decode_one`` step.
* ‚§¥Ô∏è Go back to the start.

This fundamental process works for all encoding objects, provided they implement the basic :doc:`Lucky 7 </design/lucky 7>`. Unlike the encode and decode validation functions, this one does not have anything to compare its output to. By virtue of converting from the source to the destination, it is `transcodable`. Whether or not it can be round-tripped in the other direction isn't particularly of concern, just that it can do so without error. This is the more general purpose forms of the encode or decode operations.

There are extension points used in the API that allow certain encodings to get around the limitation of having to do both the ``decode_one`` step and the ``encode_one`` step, giving individual encodings control over the verification of a single unit of input and of bulk validation as well.

Check out the API documentation for :doc:`ztd::text::validate_transcodable_as </api/conversions/validate_transcodable_as>` to learn more.
