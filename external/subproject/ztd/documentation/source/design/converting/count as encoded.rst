Count as Encoded
================

Counting encodable data is the action of finding out how many code units will result from a given sequence of already decoded information, AKA a sequence of code points. Essentially, we run the :doc:`encoding algorithm </design/converting/encode>` loop, but instead of giving the end user the encoded values, we instead simply provide the count for running that bulk operation.

Thusly, we use the algorithm as below to do the work. Given an ``input`` of ``code_unit``\ s with an ``encoding``, an initial ``count`` set at 0, and any necessary additional ``state``, we can generically predict how many code units will result from a decoding operation by running the following loop:

* ‚è© Is the ``input`` value empty? Return the current results with the the empty ``input``, curent ``count``, and ``state``, everything is okay ‚úÖ! Otherwise,

   0. Set up an ``intermediate`` storage location of ``code_unit``\ s, using the ``max_code_units`` of the input encoding, for the next operations.
   1. Do the ``encode_one`` step from ``input`` (using its ``begin()`` and ``end()``) into the ``intermediate`` ``code_unit`` storage location, saving the returned ``intermediate_output`` from the ``encode_one`` call.

      * üõë If it failed, return with the current ``input`` (unmodified from before this iteration, if possible), current ``count``, and ``state``\ s.

   2. Compute the difference between the ``begin(intermediate)`` from the original step, and the ``begin(intermediate_output)`` returned by ``encode_one``; add that difference to the current ``count``.

* ‚è© Update ``input``\ 's ``begin()`` value to point to after what was read by the ``encode_one`` step.
* ‚§¥Ô∏è Go back to the start.

This involves a single encoding type, and so does not need any cooperation to count the ``code_point``\ s. Note that this algorithm doesn't show what the error handler does; if the error handler "erases" the failure by setting the result type's ``.error_code == ztd::text::encoding_error::ok``, then the algorithm will keep going. This is useful to, for example, detect the maximum size of an operation even if it errors and would result in replacement characters being inserted (e.g., from :doc:`ztd::text::replacement_handler_t </api/error handlers/replacement_handler>`).
