Transcode
=========

Transcoding is the action of converting from one sequence of encoded information to another sequence of (usually differently) encoded information. The formula given for Transcoding is actually exactly the same as the one shown in the :ref:`main Lucky 7 documentation <design-lucky 7-transcoding loop>`, reproduced here:

.. _design-lucky 7-transcode-transcoding loop:

.. figure:: /img/transcoding-path.png
   :alt: The typical encoding path, from one encoding to another.

   The generic pathway from one encoding to another for most text Encodings.

The core tenant here is that as long as there is a common intermediary between the 2 encodings, you can decode from the given input into that shared common intermediary (e.g., :term:`unicode code points <unicode code point>` or :term:`unicode scalar values <unicode scalar value>`), then encode from the common intermediary to the second encoding's output. This is a pretty basic way of translating data and it's not even a particularly new idea (:term:`iconv <iconv>` has been doing this for well over a decade now, :term:`libogonek <libogonek>` got this core idea rolling in a C++ interface, and in general this is quite literally how all data interchange has been done since forever). The equalizer here is that, unlike other industries that struggle to define an interchange format, Unicode Code Points has become the clear and overwhelming interoperation choice for people handling text all over the world.

Thusly, we use the algorithm as below to do the work. Given an ``input`` of ``code_unit``\ s with a ``from_encoding``, a ``to_encoding`` with a target ``output``, and any necessary additional ``state``\ s, we can generically convert that one encoding to the other so long as those encodings follow the Lucky 7 design:

* ‚è© Is the ``input`` value empty? Return the current results with the the empty ``input``, ``output``, and ``state``\ s, everything is okay ‚úÖ! Otherwise,

   0. Set up an ``intermediate`` storage location of ``code_point``\ s, using the ``max_code_points`` of the input encoding as the maximum size of the storage location, for the next operation.
   1. Do the ``decode_one`` step from ``input`` (using its ``begin()`` and ``end()``) into the ``intermediate`` ``code_point`` storage location.

      * üõë If it failed, return with the current ``input`` (unmodified from before this iteration, if possible), ``output``, and ``state``\ s.

   2. Do the ``encode_one`` step from the ``intermediate`` into the ``output``.

      * üõë If it failed, return with the current ``input`` (unmodified from before this iteration, if possible), ``output``, and ``state``\ s.

* ‚è© Update ``input``\ 's ``begin()`` value to point to after what was read by the ``decode_one`` step.
* ‚§¥Ô∏è Go back to the start.

This fundamental process works for any 2 encoding pairs, and does not require the first encoding ``from_encoding`` to know any details about the second encoding ``to_encoding``! This means a user is only responsible for upholding their end of the bargain with their encoding object, and can thusly interoperate with every other encoding that speaks in the same intermediade, decoded values (i.e. :term:`unicode code points <unicode code point>`).
