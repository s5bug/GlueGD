Writing A Handler
=================

When put together, it can generally look like this:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/snippets/source/error_handler.custom.ascii.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:start-after: // ============================================================================>

The result in ``my_ascii_string`` should be an empty string: nothing should have succeeded and therefore the function will just return an empty string. The print out will look like this:

.. code-block:: none

	An error occurred.
		Error code value: invalid_sequence
		# of unused characters: 1
		Input units left: 1
	An error occurred.
		Error code value: invalid_sequence
		# of unused characters: 1
		Input units left: 0

If you would like the higher-level called function to return more information to you, use the lower level :doc:`encode_to/encode_into </api/conversions/encode>`, :doc:`decode_to/decode_into </api/conversions/decode>`, :doc:`transcode_to/transcode_into </api/conversions/transcode>`.

If you need to do more, you can change from concrete types to templates, and work at increasingly higher levels of genericity in order to have the printing handler do more and more.
